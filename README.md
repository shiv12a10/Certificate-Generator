üë©‚Äçüè≠----------------------------Let's Begin with Problem Statement----------------------üë©‚Äçüè≠

Our Problem Statement is like 
In a college, students from different sections study various topics or courses. The college administration faced significant challenges in managing certificate generation for these students. The existing manual process had several limitations:

:- Time-Consuming for Faculty Members: Manually generating certificates required significant effort and time.
:- Error-Prone Data Handling: Frequent mistakes occurred while handling and managing large volumes of data.
:- Lack of Centralized Control: The process lacked a unified platform where administrators could oversee and monitor certificate-related activities.
:- Inefficient Distribution: Sharing certificates with students required additional manual effort, leading to delays.

The college needed a centralized solution that could address these issues by providing:

:- A system where the main dean or principal could manage faculty members which is admins.
:- A portal where faculty admins could independently generate certificates for their assigned sections.
:- A secure mechanism to store and access certificates for future reference.
:- Automated certificate distribution via email, reducing delays and manual effort.

So now let's go with solution
The project addresses these challenges by creating a Certificate Management Portal that offers the following features:
Role-Based Access
Dean or Principal:
:- Acts as the super admin with complete control over the platform.
:- Creates and manages accounts for faculty admins.
:- Monitors all certificate generation and validation activities.

Faculty Admins:

:- Responsible for their assigned sections.
:- Generate certificates for their respective students.
:- Validate or Invalidate Certificates to control their authenticity.

Certificate Generation
:- Faculty admins input the necessary details example student names, course, section.
:- Certificates are dynamically created using a PDF generator, ensuring consistency and professionalism.
   Cloud Storage
:- Certificates are securely uploaded and stored in AWS S3 Buckets.
:- Each certificate has a unique URL stored in the database for easy retrieval by students or faculty.

Email Integration
:- Once a certificate is generated, it is automatically sent to the student‚Äôs registered email address as an attachment.
:- The email includes a direct link to the certificate stored in the AWS S3 bucket.
